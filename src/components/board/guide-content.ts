// The Guide page's prose lives here, written ONCE and reused for every client.
// The page component (GuidePage in BrandBoard.tsx) stays thin — it reads this
// copy and interpolates the few client-specific bits (brand name, the actual
// role colors, which applications are present). Keeping the words in one place
// means the guide's voice is edited here, not scattered through JSX.
//
// Voice: CONTENT_STYLE_GUIDE.md — smart friend catching the client up, not a
// manual. No lists-of-three, no em-dash crutch, no "not X but Y".
//
// This page is SELF-CONTAINED and package-agnostic: it never points at any other
// file in the kit, because different Fiverr tiers ship different pieces (a client
// may have no QR, no signature). Every row is gated on the asset actually being
// present, so the guide only ever describes what's really in that client's kit.
